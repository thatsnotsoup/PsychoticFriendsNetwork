<h1>Psychotic Friends Network File Server</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Psychotic Friends Network file server! A place where we can upload random files we feel like uploading. Things you'll find here include music, games, mods, memes, etc. Things that don't need to be on the main website. Think of it as one big Git repo, or FTP server. except this isn't actually FTP or Git based.</p>
