<h1>Wanna hear some jokes I'd get FUCKING TASED for because they're just that funny?!</h1>

<p>(And also some gags and other funny shit, comebacks, etc)<p>

<p>Well alrighty!</p>

<p>Strip that oak log like it's Queen!<p>

<p>The name of this website<p>

<p>You see how hard it is to not scream "AW PISS!" After someone tackles you!<p>

<p>THE FOCKING BASS IS FOCKING ROW! (Why would I say it so much if I didn't think it was fucking hilarious?)<p>
