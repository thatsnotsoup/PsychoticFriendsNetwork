<p>Update 1.4! Now the lights flicker! Spoopy! Now it looks more like a late 90's website than a mid 90's website!<p>
<p>(But still feels like it could pass for a mid-90's website made by a genius or some shit.)<p>
<p>If the website is slow, it's because it's hosting a shitton of music, images, and a fucking Half Life server<p>

<h1>The others say it smells like teen spirit. I say it smells like the '90s.<h1>

<h1>Best viewed in any resolution! Fuck resolution and fuck the democracy!<h1>

<h1>Psychotic Friends Network</h1>

<p>Psychotic Friends Network is a club of lunatics. Join us if your a fucking idiot.<p>

<p>Our members include....<p>
<p>Queen Amadeus The First! Everyone must simp for her.<p>
<p>Alex "Motherfucker", You can't hate her no matter how hard you try.<p>
<p>Icy Thot, the disappointment, whatever the fuck she goes by.<p>
<p>Pengu, He's probably proud  of me for fucking the shit out of democracy.<p>
<p>Bloxy, the person I'm referring to when I say "I" or "Me", I'm the guy that gave this shithole life.<p>
<p>Micah, can't forget him. He's not interesting in any specific ways, but he's definitely fun to talk to!<p>
<p>Painbringer, the edgelord and the 2nd most likely person to know how to do this clunky HTML shit, besides me.<p>
<p>Yipper, the one that told an 8 year old that "faggot" is a compliment you should tell gay people.<p> 
<p>And, finally, Chopter. A small child that likes Minecraft and knows alot about atoms or some shit, I wasn't paying attention.<p>

<p>Bloxy's Bio</p>

<p>I wear clothes. Until my queen tells me not to, than, she ties me up and we fuck the shit out of eachother.
I indulge in her tight twat and beg for more as she moans in pleasure as my massive cock fucks her.
Alright, enough of the horny erotica. I like Doom and that's all you need to know. Any more, and you will be
mentally scarred beyond repair, imagine having 3 people's deep, fucked up emotional baggage, dumped onto you,
all at once, yea, I wouldn't want that either. So, now that I've scared half the readers away within the first
sentence, how 'ya do?<p>

<p>Oh and you can't forget my oddly specific addiction to water from the Colorado river, what can I say? Shit's good and it's laced
with heroin. Who doesn't want that?</p>

<h1>I'm sorry but all the other dumbasses are surprisingly too busy sleeping at 11PM to write their own bios.<h1>
